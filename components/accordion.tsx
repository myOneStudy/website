Say goodbye to outdated and subpar study decks, as OneStudy seamlessly integrates your own content into your study materials (e.g. lectures, research papers, etc.). <br /> <br /> Even in cases where Anki decks are outdated or missing, OneStudy ensures your study approach remains intact by allowing fast and efficient deck creation, perfectly suited to your busy schedule."

          answer="It's incredibly straightforward and intuitive. You simply upload your PDF, and OneStudy converts the pertinent text into text flashcards.
